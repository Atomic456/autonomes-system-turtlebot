[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:47 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenCV" (requested
  version 3) with any of the following names:

    OpenCVConfig.cmake
    opencv-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenCV" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenCV_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "OpenCV"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
